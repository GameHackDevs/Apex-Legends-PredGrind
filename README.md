Apex Legends Legit Game Hack / Cheat that we are releasing for the public to now enjoy as well
Apex-Private-PredGrind 2024
Apex Legends Private Cheat we are finally releasing to the public. Always has been undetected and we will be updating until probably season 23. Win 10 and 11, intel or amd;

This was used by myself and about 2 more squads since season 16, never once detected. Personally I got to pred 4 times, currently not banned and account is in the upper level 400's. We all are extremely busy with work, family, etc....and just do not need to use this as our personal private cheat anymore, but as we do play on and off still we will be keeping it updated. Remember, if the game updates, wait a few hours/maybe a few days until we post an updated version to account for the new game variables. Run the .exe file and then start apex, from the EA app or Steam, within a minute of starting the program. Once you get in game you use the "Insert" key to interact with the GUI menu, and obviously then use the arrow keys to scroll through tabs and options to set them however you desire. This can be used by rage cheaters or people that are playing ranked and trying to look 100% legit, and as long as YOU ARE NOT AN IDIOT, you can play, well should I say, DOMINATE, and not be looked at as a cheater. But if you are popping a bat behind cover, staring straight at the wall watching another squad, then immmediately pop out starting to shoot at their exact position, your aimbot is set like a rager, and you get banned, please do not leave any stupid comments anywhere. So if you want to play legit with this, like I said we all hit pred no problem, but it is Inevitably up to you being an intelligent cheater!
